# rplay
This repository will hold the code used to make 'play', a CLI to let a user jump into a game right away just by typing in a partial name of the game

### Steps

1. Have app know where to look for games

    - Either manually set locations as env variables or

    - Possible to have app automatically look for them?

        - Could maybe set up what is found as environment variables later

2. Then do a search for game

3. If only one possible match, launch executable found?

4. If multiple matches, give user a choice
